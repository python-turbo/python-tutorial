    "## Conditional Statements\n",
    "Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a certain condition is true or false. In Python, the two main types of conditional statements are if statements and if-else statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "An if statement checks whether a condition is true, and if it is, executes a block of code. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "if x > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "This code checks whether x is greater than 0, and if it is, prints the message \"x is positive\". If x is not greater than 0, the code does nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "An if-else statement is similar to an if statement, but also includes a block of code to be executed if the condition is false. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "x = -5\n",
    "if x > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is not positive\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "This code checks whether x is greater than 0, and if it is, prints the message \"x is positive\". If x is not greater than 0, the code executes the else block and prints the message \"x is not positive\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use elif (short for \"else if\") to check additional conditions. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "x = 0\n",
    "if x > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "elif x < 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is negative\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is zero\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "This code checks whether x is greater than 0, and if it is, prints the message \"x is positive\". If x is not greater than 0, it checks whether x is less than 0, and if it is, prints the message \"x is negative\". If neither of those conditions is true, the code executes the else block and prints the message \"x is zero\"."

    "In Python, None is a special value that represents the absence of a value. It can be used as a placeholder when a variable or parameter needs to be assigned a value later.\n",

    "### Shortcut feature of logical operators\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, logical operators and and or have a shortcut feature that can be useful in certain situations. When using and, if the first expression is false, the whole expression will be false regardless of the value of the second expression, so the second expression is not evaluated. Similarly, when using or, if the first expression is true, the whole expression will be true regardless of the value of the second expression, so the second expression is not evaluated. This can save computation time when evaluating complex expressions or when the second expression may cause an error.\n",

    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "x = 10\n",

    "if y > 0 and x/y > 0.5:\n",
    "    print(\"True\")\n",

    "In this case, the second condition x/y > 0.5 will not be evaluated if y > 0 is false, because the entire expression will be false regardless of the value of x/y > 0.5. This can save time and prevent potential errors that may arise from evaluating x/y > 0.5 when y is zero or negative."
